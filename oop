Java Classes
A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.  A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object.

class Test {
       // class body
       member variables
       methods
}

Java Objects
An object is a major element in a class which has a state and behavior. It is an instance of a class which can access your data. The ‘new’ keyword is used to create the object.

//Declaring and Initializing an object
 `Test t = new Test();`
